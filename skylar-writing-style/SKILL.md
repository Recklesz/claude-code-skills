# Skylar Writing Style

Apply these principles to all writing:

## Principles

### Intentionality
Every word and sentence must have a purpose. No empty words like "valuable", "innovative", or "cutting-edge".

### Simplicity
Write for a 5th grader:
- Use one or two syllable words when possible
- Keep sentences short
- Use short paragraphs (2-3 sentences)

### Flow
Each sentence should pull the reader to the next one.

### Engagement
Create a "slippery slope" where readers get immersed:
- Start with a compelling hook
- Build momentum through the piece

### Rhetorical Devices
Use repetition, metaphors, and rhetorical questions sparingly. Only at the right moments.

### Tone
Professional but personal. Thread the line carefully:

```
Over the last 12 months, our team at Skylar has [WORD] to over 400 sales leaders.

1. chatted - too casual
2. engaged - too professional
3. spoken - threads the line (use this)
```

## Examples

**Bad:** "Our valuable platform provides innovative solutions that empower sales teams."

**Good:** "We help sales teams close more deals."

**Bad:** "Leverage our cutting-edge AI capabilities to optimize your sales performance metrics."

**Good:** "Our AI shows reps what works. They learn faster. They sell more."
